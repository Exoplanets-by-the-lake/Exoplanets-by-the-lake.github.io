							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>In its wake, the pandemic has dramatically transformed the way that academia conducts its conferences, workshops and summer schools.  
								Most academic events now offer hybrid formats, allowing for the possibility of remote participation.  
								Exoplanets by the Lake is intended to be a signature summer school series that aims to reinstate an interactive, 
								in-person summer school format among participants that is not easily achievable online.  
								In 2025, our focus is on the study of the atmospheres of exoplanets using the James Webb Space Telescope, and the lessons 
								we may learn from analyzing and interpreting the measured spectra.  We also wish to look ahead and think about the 
								astrobiological implications of these spectral analysis on future efforts to identify life in rocky exoplanets. 
							<h4>The distinctive features of the summer school include:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Emphasis on in-person interaction at an attractive, self-contained venue with at most 20 participants.
										The number of participants is kept small in order to encourage unrestricted, interactive discussions among
										exoplanet scientists of all sub-disciplines and seniority.</li>
									<li>The event will be held for 5.5 days (5 nights).  The first 3 weekdays involve pedagogical lectures during the
										day.  There is an optional half-day excursion, via ship on the lake.
										The last 2 days feature a mini-conference format, where a small number of invited experts
										share their views and interact with the participants.  Participants have the chance to contribute short
										talks, if desired. </li>
								</ul>
							The intended audience of this summer school ranges from Master students to junior postdocs.
							Both experts and curious newcomers to the topic are welcome to attend.  Senior scientists who are intending to switch research
							directions and/or attending as active listeners are also welcome.

								<dt>Stephen Mojzsis</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Stephen Mojzsis is an Earth scientist who uses physical, chemical and dynamical tools to 
										understand the natural world. My research is field-, laboratory- and modeling-based, 
										and explores the planetary scale geodynamic conditions that give rise to Earth and 
										Earth-like planets. In Budapest, he is a Director at the Research Centre for Astronomy 
										and Earth Sciences (CsFK) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest, Hungary. 
										He was previously the director of the Collaborative for Research in Origins (CRiO) at 
										the University of Colorado, Boulder, USA. He was the recipient of numerous NASA grants, 
										and awards. Furthermore, he holds academic positions at the University of Vienna 
										(Ida Pfeiffer Visiting Professor, Senior Research Association), University of Jena, 
										Germany (A.v. Humboldt Research Prize Visiting Professor) and the University of Colorado. </p>
		                        
								</dd>
								<dt>Fabrice Gaillard</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Fabrice Gaillard is an experimental geochemist and geophysicist with a consolidated background in 
										petrology and chemical thermodynamics. He is best known for his contributions to the understanding 
										of volatile elements in magmatic systems with implications for the mantle and crust geodynamics, 
										but he also contributed to model mantle degassing and its relationships with atmospheric evolution 
										on Earth and beyond. He received his B.S. degree in Geological Sciences at the University of Grenoble
										in 1996, and his M.S. degree and PhD degrees at the University of Orléans in 1997 and 2001, respectively. 
										He has been postdoc research associates at the Bayerisches GeoInstitut (BGI, 2001-2005). 
										In 2005 he joined the CNRS (French national centre for scientific research), and since then he has been 
										working at the ISTO (Institute of Earth Sciences at Orléans). In 2015, he obtained the highest French degree, 
										the “habilitation à diriger des recherches”, and became director of research at CNRS in 2018. 
										Since 2017, he is head of the “MAGMA” group at ISTO. Fabrice has coordinated 3 ANR grants 
										(French agency for research) and 1 ERC project (European research council). </p>
